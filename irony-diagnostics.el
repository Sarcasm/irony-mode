  "Perform an asynchronous diagnostic request for the current
buffer.

Use FORCE to force the reparsing of the buffer.

CALLBACK is called with at least one argument, a symbol
representing the status of the request. Depending on the status
more argument are provided. Possible values are explained below:

- success

  When quering the diagnostics work, the additional argument is a
  list of diagnostic object, diagnostics fields can be queried
  with the functions `irony-diagnostics-<xxx>'.

- error

  Retrieving the diagnostics wasn't possible. A string explaining
  the reason is passed as a second argument.

- cancelled

  Retrieving the diagnostics was cancelled, e.g: because the
  buffer has changed since the beginning of the request, and as
  such the diagnostics are considered no longer relevant. A
  reason string is passed as a second argument."
