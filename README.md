# Irony-Mode

## A C/C++ minor mode powered by [libclang][libclang-ref]

`irony-mode` is an Emacs minor-mode that aims at improving the editing
experience for the C, C++ and Objective-C languages. It works by using a
combination of an Emacs package and a C++ program (`irony-server`) that uses
[libclang][libclang-ref].

**Features:**

* Code completion:
  * With Emacs' built-in `completion-at-point-functions`
  * With [company-mode][company-ref]'s backend: [company-irony][company-irony-ref]
  * With [auto-complete][ac-ref]' source: [ac-irony][ac-irony-ref]

* Diagnostic reporting:
  * With [flycheck][flycheck-ref]'s checker: [flycheck-irony][flycheck-irony-ref]

* Integration with eldoc-mode: [irony-eldoc][irony-eldoc-ref]

## Dependencies

### Elisp dependencies

These dependencies will be installed automatically when using the
[standard installation](#installation) procedure described below.

| Package              | Comment                                                                          |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [cl-lib][cl-lib-ref] | Built-in since Emacs 24.3                                                        |

| [YASnippet][yas-ref] | Optional. May be used to provide post-completion expansion of function arguments |


### Irony-Server prerequisites

`irony-server` provides the [libclang][libclang-ref] interface to `irony-mode`.
It uses a simple protocol based on S-expression. This server, written in C++ and
requires the following packages to be installed on your system:

* [CMake][cmake-ref] >= 2.8.3
* [libclang][libclang-ref]


## Installation

The recommended way to install `irony-mode` and its dependencies is to use a
package manager.

* Using [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/)

        M-x package-install RET irony RET

* Using [el-get](https://github.com/dimitri/el-get)

        M-x el-get-install RET irony-mode RET


## Configuration

~~~el
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'irony-mode)
(add-hook 'objc-mode-hook 'irony-mode)

;; replace the `completion-at-point' and `complete-symbol' bindings in
;; irony-mode's buffers by irony-mode's function
(defun my-irony-mode-hook ()
  (define-key irony-mode-map [remap completion-at-point]
    'irony-completion-at-point-async)
  (define-key irony-mode-map [remap complete-symbol]
    'irony-completion-at-point-async))
(add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'my-irony-mode-hook)
(add-hook 'irony-mode-hook 'irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options)
~~~


## Windows considerations

`irony-mode` should work fine on Windows but there are some things to take care
of first.

* `libclang.dll` is expected to be available in the `PATH` or in Emacs'
  `exec-path`.

* **Emacs >= 24.4 is required.** A bug in previous versions makes irony
  unuseable (Emacs bug #18420).

* `w32-pipe-read-delay` default value of `50` should be changed.
  This should not cause any issue on today's version of Windows.
  The default value of `50` may be lowered in mainline Emacs in future versions,
  until then, I suggest to set it to `0`.

* `w32-pipe-buffer-size`, introduced by Emacs 25,
  can be set to a larger value than the default to improve
  `irony-server` communication performances
  (c.f. https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode/issues/321).
  The variable to customize is `irony-server-w32-pipe-buffer-size`.


Windows configuration tweaks to add to your Emacs configuration:

```el
;; Windows performance tweaks
;;
(when (boundp 'w32-pipe-read-delay)
  (setq w32-pipe-read-delay 0))
;; Set the buffer size to 64K on Windows (from the original 4K)
(when (boundp 'w32-pipe-buffer-size)
  (setq irony-server-w32-pipe-buffer-size (* 64 1024)))
```


## Usage

On the first run, `irony-mode` will ask you to build and install `irony-server`.
To do so, type `M-x irony-install-server RET`.

To tune `irony-mode`, use `customize`:


    M-x customize-group RET irony RET

In order to provide context sensitive and accurate information, `irony-mode`
needs to know about the compiler flags used to parse the current buffer. The
best way to achieve this is to use a
[Compilation Database](#compilation-database).


## Compilation Database

In order to work correctly, `irony-mode` needs to know the compile flags.
`irony-cdb` aims to provide *as automatic as possible* compile flags discovery,
with minimal user input.

Please refer to `irony-cdb-autosetup-compile-options` and
`irony-cdb-compilation-databases`.

Right now `irony-cdb` supports the following compilation databases:

* [JSON Compilation Database][clang-compile-db-ref] - A JSON formatted file
  generated by various build tools. The file is named `compile_commands.json`,
  it lists the compile options associated to each file in the project.

  * [CMake >= 2.8.5][cmake-ref] will generate a compilation database in the
    build directory when issuing the following command
    `cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON <...>`.

  * [ninja >= 1.2][ninja-ref] will generate a JSON Compilation Database when
    using the `compdb` tool.

  * [Bear][bear-ref] generates a JSON Compilation Database file by "monitoring"
    the build of a project. The typical usage for a `make`-based project will be
    `bear -- make -B`.

* [.clang_complete][clang_complete-doc-ref] - A file at the root of your project
  containing the compilation flags, one per line. This is compatible with the
  with plugin [Rip-Rip/clang_complete][clang_complete-vim-ref]. If you want to
  generate the `.clang_complete` automatically, take a look at the
  [cc_args.py documentation][cc_args-py-doc-ref].

More detailed information on compilation database is available here:

## FAQ

__It's slow, why?__

A bug in old version of Clang (at least '3.1-8') caused the completion to fail
on the standard library types. To eliminate this bug an optimisation has been
disabled in the parsing of a translation unit. This result in a slower parsing.

This only affect old versions of Clang (< 3.2), it is suggested to update your
libclang installation if you want to take advantage of the optimizations.

__libclang.so: cannot open shared object file...__

Compiling `irony-server` succeed but you have the following message when you try
to run the `irony-server` executable:

    'irony-server: error while loading shared libraries: libclang.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

When `libclang` is installed in a non-standard location (one that is missing
from the path list of the dynamic loader, see *ld.so.conf*) you can tell CMake
to use the [rpath][rpath-ref] when installing the target `irony-server`. To
enable rpath in CMake use the following command:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH=ON <args...>

If you're running OS X, you can also use `install_name_tool` to explicitly
tell `irony-server` where an appropriate version of `libclang.dylib` lives.
For example, Homebrew (with `brew install llvm --with-clang`) will install
a `libclang.dylib` library at `/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/libclang.dylib`;
you can instruct `irony-server` to use this with something like:

    install_name_tool -change @rpath/libclang.dylib /usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/libclang.dylib irony-server
